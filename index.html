<h1><hr /><b>Muktinath Temple Tour Package - Overview</b><hr /> </h1>
<h2><b><u> About Muktinath</u></b></h2>
<p>  <strong> <i> Muktinath Temple</strong> </i>word is derived from Mukti and Nath. "Mukti" means "Salvation or Nirvana" and "Nath" means "God or Master". Mukti Holds great significance for all spiritual people in the south Asian sub-continent. Muktinath this Sanskrit name itself has religious overtone and a sort of emotional ring to it for the devout Hindus. The name is a synthesis of two words - (the provider of salvation) has been one such holy site, where thousands of devotees flock for attaining the much sought after moksha (Freedom) from the cycle of birth and rebirth.  <br/>
It is an ardent wish or a dream if you may say, of every Hindu to get Mukti-Nirvana from this cycle taking births over and over again. It is a belief of the Hindus that this world is "MAYA" (an illusion) and the earliest one gets out of it the better and a visit to Muktinath will help them achieve that goal. Since then it called Muktinath.</p>

<p>The Hindus call it Muktichhetra (place of salvation) is one of the four religious sites. Many Shaligrams (Ammonite) found during Muktinath Yatra over here are considered by Hindu as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and worship them. According to Hindu Myth lord Vishnu turned into Shaligram because of Brinda's Curse. Muktinath Temple is opened throughout the year but especially in Rishitarpani, Ram Navami, and Bijay Dashami thousands of pilgrims gather here to celebrate the festival. </p>
